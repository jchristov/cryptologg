# CryptoLogg
CryptoLogg only shows the price change of cryptocurrencies since the last time you checked. This is to discourage you from checking the values of your investments often.

CryptoLogg was built in ~~React~~ Preact and Sass using the CryptoCompare API and localStorage. The project was compiled with ~~Gulp~~ Webpack.

It was featured on [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/cryptologg) and [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cryptologg).
